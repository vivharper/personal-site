In tandem with the accessibility overhaul, I partnered with my UX counterpart to solidify our design token taxonomy and ensure that what was established in Figma would integrate into our repository and we could keep the primitive and semantic tokens in sync automatically between softwares. We eventually completed our accessibility rework and published our tokens in Q3 2024, bringing much needed consistency to the AA digital environment."}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Over the course of those months, we encountered some specific issues in regards to accessibility, analytics, and server side rendering using Lit web components. We came to the conclusion that the design system needed to expand to better accommodate our frontend landscape in IT, and this promted a technology investigation to propose to Director level stakeholders. The frontend space at AA spans both Angular and React, and Lit was chosen as a framework agnostic solution to accommodate both. With the goal to expand the design system and close the gaps stated before, we approached leadership with a comprehensive study and recommendation on the route we felt the design system should take. After compromising, our directive shifted to creating additional component packages to support modern Angular versions and upon completion of the initial 12 component for Angular we would supplement the same 12 in React and repeat until our library had all our previous components offered in Lit and could expand in the future."}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"children":"The dedication of my team to pursue this component creation structure was supported by IT pushing a modernization effort to align Angular users on an acceptable rolling band of versions to align with the design system and to mitigate securtiy vulnerabilities.
